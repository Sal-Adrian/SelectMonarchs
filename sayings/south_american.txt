The baby who does not cry is not nursed
A dog that barks all the time gets little attention
A dog with many masters dies of starvation
Even the candle seller dies in the dark
For our sins God has created three enemies for us: mice in the house, the fox in 
the mountains, and a priest in our village
God is big, but the forest is bigger
God writes on crooked lines
Hands that give also receive
He who prays a lot is afraid of something
He who saves up for another day has no trust in God
If it were ever to rain soup, the poor would only have forks
If you have a tail of straw, then keep away from the fi re
Laughing wife, crying purse
No one knows as much about the pot as does the spoon
A sleeping fox fi nds no meat
The one who loves you will also make you weep
That which is a sin in others is a virtue in ourselves
There is nothing hidden between heaven and earth
Tomorrow is as good as today
You make a road by walking on it
