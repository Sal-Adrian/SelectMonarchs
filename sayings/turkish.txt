Coffee should be black as hell, strong as death, and sweet as love
The eagle does not feed on fl ies
A friend is one soul in two bodies
He who controls his tongue saves his head
He who has no children has one sorrow, he who has children has a thousand 
sorrows
A hungry dog will bring a lion down
If you fall in a river hang on to a snake
If you look for a faultless woman you will remain a bachelor
In the company of the blind, close your eyes
To live in peace one must be blind, deaf, and mute
Measure a thousand times, cut once
No matter how far down a wrong road you are, turn back
One armpit cannot hold two watermelons
One bad experience is worth more than a thousand threats
One eats, another watches; that’s how revolutions are born
Profi t is the brother of loss
Sometimes you have to sacrifi ce your beard in order to save your head
So the music, so the people
When God wants to please a poor man, He lets him lose his donkey and then 
helps him fi nd it again
You don’t wash blood away with blood but with water
