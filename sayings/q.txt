the quarrel of lovers is the renewal 
of love  A loving relationship is often 
reestablished on a fi rmer footing after an 
argument: “The falling out of Lovers . . . is 
the renewal of Love. Are we not now bet-
ter friends than if we had never differed?” 
(Samuel Richardson, Sir Charles Grandison, 
1754). The proverb is of ancient origin, 
occurring in the Roman poet Terence’s 
Andria (second century b.c.): “Amantium 
irae amoris integratio est [Lovers’ quarrels 
are a strengthening of love].”
Variant of this proverb: the falling 
out of lovers is the renewing of love.
quickly come, quickly go  Something 
that arises suddenly is likely to disappear 
just as suddenly; also used of something 
that is rapidly gained and lost: It is an 
unpleasant illness, but rarely lasts more than 
a few days—quickly come, quickly go. The 
proverb was fi rst recorded in this form in 
1869 in W. C. Hazlitt’s English Proverbs.

quit while you are ahead  Give up doing 
something when you are in a good posi-
tion rather than risk what you have

more game but remembered the adage “quit 
while you are ahead.” The proverb was 
first recorded c. 1350 in the Douce MS.
Variant of this proverb: leave off 
while the play is good.
