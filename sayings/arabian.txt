Better a thousand enemies outside the tent than one within
Better to be a free dog than a caged lion
Death rides a fast camel
Donâ€™t pour away your water on the strength of a mirage
Fate loves a rebel
A good deed dies when it is spoken about
He who has been bitten by a snake is scared of a rope on the ground
If we are both masters, then who shall lead the mules?
It is better to cut off the head that has no pride
It is not the bullet that kills you, it is fate
Kiss the hand of your enemy if you cannot chop it off
Men fear, but time fears the pyramids
The monkey looks into the mirror and sees a gazelle
A mule can go to Mecca, but it will not come back as a pilgrim
Never trust a fool with a sword
Peace is only possible after war
Talent without skill is like a desert without an oasis
A thousand curses never tore a shirt
Trust in Allah, but tie up your camel
Two scorpions living in the same hole will get along better than two sisters in the 
same house
Whoever knew you when you were small will not respect you when you are big
You know a man by the sweat of his brow and the strength of his word
