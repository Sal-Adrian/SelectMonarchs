All things seem diffi cult at fi rst
Almond nuts come to those who have no teeth
Always leave a little room for a mistake
Before you prepare to improve the world, look around your own house three times
Do not climb a tree to catch a fi sh
Do not remove a fl y from your friend’s forehead with a hatchet
Drunkards talk to the gods
Every book must be chewed to get out its juice
The fi rst time you cheat me, be ashamed. The second time it is I who must be 
ashamed
He who is not friendly towards a good guest will never have one
He who rides a tiger can never get off
If no one comes, the dog does not bark
If you are not a fi sh, how can you know if the fi sh are happy?
If you don’t climb the mountain, you can’t view the plain
If you wish to succeed, consult three old people
It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step
Love your neighbors but don’t pull down the fence
One bamboo does not make a forest
One joy scatters a hundred griefs
Only one who can swallow an insult is a man
Pain is easier to endure than an itch
A picture is worth ten thousand words
Procrastination is the thief of time
Rivalry between scholars improves science
A thousand workers, a thousand plans
A tiger cannot beat a crowd of monkeys
A wise man will not rebuke a fool
