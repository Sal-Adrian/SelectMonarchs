Absence is the enemy of love
A cask of wine works more miracles than a church full of saints
Adam must have an Eve to blame for his faults
All are not saints who go to church
Bed is the poor manâ€™s opera
Better one true friend than a hundred relatives
By asking the impossible you will get the best
The end of the pig is the beginning of the sausage
Every excuse is good, if it works
Failures are but mileposts on the road to success
He that is afraid of the devil does not grow rich
If it rained macaroni, what a fi ne time for gluttons!
If you would succeed, you must not be too good
It may be quieter to sleep alone, but not warmer
A kiss without a moustache is like beef without mustard
A meal without wine is like a day without sunshine
Virginity is noted only by its absence
What worth has beauty if it is not seen?
Whoever stays awake longest must blow out the candle
Who has no courage must have legs
You must marry a widow while she is still mourning
