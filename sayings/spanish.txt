Beware of women with beards and men without beards
Don’t call me a little olive until you have picked me
A face that never laughs betrays an evil heart
God is good, but not crazy
The hand of the stranger is heavy
Her father’s fortune will make the ugliest girl attractive
How beautiful it is to do nothing, and then rest afterward
I dance to the tune that is played
If I die, I forgive you; if I recover, we shall see
If you have nothing better to do, go to bed with your own wife
Insults should be well avenged or well endured
Italians talk to women, Frenchmen to the learned, and the Spaniard talks to God
The man deliberates, the woman decides
A mother-in-law made of sugar still tastes bitter
Only God helps the badly dressed
An ounce of mother is worth a ton of priest
Soup must be hot, insults cold
Spanish is the language of lovers, Italian is for the singer, French for diplomats, 
and German for horses
There is no woman who sleeps so deeply that the sound of a guitar will not bring 
her to the window
There was already twenty in the family, so my grandmother had a baby
Three Spaniards, four opinions
Tomorrow is often the busiest day of the week
Who gossips with you will gossip about you
