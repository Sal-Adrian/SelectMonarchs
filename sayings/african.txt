The best trees grow on the steepest hills
By trying often, the monkey learns to jump from the tree
Do not blame God for having created the tiger, but thank him for not giving it wings
Even if the elephant is thin he is still the lord of the jungle
Even the best cooking pot will not produce food
Every beast roars in its own den
Fear is no obstacle to death
Goats cannot live in a herd of leopards
He on whose head we would break a coconut never stands still
The horizon will not disappear as you run towards it
Hunt in every jungle, for there is wisdom and good hunting in all of them
If there were no elephants in the jungle, the buffalo would be big
If they are offered winged ants, people will eat them
If you have escaped the jaws of the crocodile while bathing in the river, you will 
surely meet a leopard on the way
If you have fi ve wives, then you have fi ve tongues
Rain does not fall on one roof alone
The smaller the lizard the greater the hope of becoming a crocodile
The viper assumes the colors of his surroundings
When you chop off a snakeâ€™s head all you are left with is a piece of rope
Where the cattle stand together, the lion lies down hungry
Where there is no wealth there is no poverty
