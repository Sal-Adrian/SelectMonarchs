Ask a lot, but take what is offered
Better a bed of wood than a bier of gold
Don’t praise your furnace when the house is cold
Eat until you are half full; drink until you are half drunk
An enemy will agree, but a friend will argue
Eternal peace lasts until the next war
Eternity makes room for a salty cucumber
Even in the ashes there will be a few sparks
He who offers his back should not complain if it is beaten
Honor goes to God; the priests get the bacon
The horses of hope gallop, but the asses of experience go slowly
If you don’t have a hundred roubles, make sure you have a hundred friends
In Russia every day is of thirty hours
In the lake of lies there are many dead fi sh
No one is hanged who has money in his pocket
One cannot make a fur coat from a thank-you
Only chained bears dance
Thanks to one small candle the whole of Moscow burns
Vodka is the aunt of wine
Who lives in exile fi nds that spring has no charm
Who wants heat must endure the smoke
You can’t sew buttons on your neighbor’s mouth
Your body belongs to the Tsar, your soul to God, and your back to the squire
