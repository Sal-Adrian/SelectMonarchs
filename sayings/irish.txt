Age is honourable and youth is 
noble
Both your friend and your enemy 
think you will never die
The day will come when the cow 
will have use for her tail
A drink precedes a story
Falling is easier than rising
Godâ€™s help is nearer than the door
Good as drink is, it ends in thirst
He who comes with a story to you 
brings two away from you
If you hit my dog you hit myself
It is sweet to drink but bitter to 
pay for
The light heart lives long
There is no fi reside like your own 
fi reside
There is no need like the lack of 
a friend
This is better than the thing we 
never had
Time is a great story teller
Two shorten the road
When the drop is inside, the 
sense is outside
When you are right no one 
remembers; when you are 
wrong no one forgets
Wine divulges truth
Women do not drink liquor, but 
it disappears when they are 
present
