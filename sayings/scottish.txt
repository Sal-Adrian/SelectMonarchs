A bad wound may heal, but a bad name will kill
A blind man needs no looking glass
The devil’s a busy bishop in his own diocese
A hungry man smells meat far
All that’s said in the kitchen should not be told in the hall
Enough’s as good as a feast
Every man to his taste, as the man said when he kissed his cow
From saving comes having
Get what you can and keep what you have; that’s the way to get rich
Good company on a journey is worth a coach
If I had a dog as daft, I would shoot him
If you don’t see the bottom, don’t wade
Laws catch fl ies, but let hornets go free
A man cannot wive and thrive the same year
Many a mickle makes a muckle
A nod’s as good as a wink to a blind horse
One whisky is all right; two is too much; three is too few
Penny wise and pound foolish
War makes thieves, and peace hangs them
A wise lawyer never goes to law himself
Ye may not sit in Rome and strive with the Pope
You will never know a man till you do business with him
