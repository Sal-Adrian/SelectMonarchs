The best goods are the cheapest
Better lose the anchor than the whole ship
Better poor on land than rich at sea
A crown is no cure for the headache
Everyone is a thief in his own craft
Froth is not beer
Good-looking apples are sometimes sour
Great boast, little roast
A handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains
He that has a choice has trouble
A man overboard, one mouth less to feed
A man without money is like a ship without sails
Poverty is the reward of idleness
The rich have many friends
Set your expense according to your trade
A usurer, a miller, a banker, and a publican are the four evangelists of Lucifer
What costs nothing is worth nothing
Who watches not catches not
The world likes to be cheated
Your friend lends and your enemy asks for payment
