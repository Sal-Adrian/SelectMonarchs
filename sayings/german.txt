Beauty is the eye’s food but the soul’s sorrow
Begged bread has a hard crust
Better a good hanging than a bad marriage
Birds of prey do not sing
Boredom is the father of all sins
Don’t throw away your old shoes until you have a new pair
Even the devil’s grandmother was a nice girl when she was young
Fire in the heart sends smoke to the head
He who does not punish evil invites it
He who has no enemies has no friends either
He who has not tasted bitter things, knows not what sweet is
Howling makes the wolf bigger than he really is
High climbers and deep swimmers never grow old
A lie becomes true when one believes it
More people drown in glasses than in rivers
Never give advice unless asked
Never tickle the nose of a sleeping bear
No bed is big enough to hold three
The silent dog is the fi rst to bite
Time is anger’s medicine
Two is an army against one
What little Hans did not learn, big Hans does not know
When an old man marries, death laughs
Where there is no jealousy there is no love
