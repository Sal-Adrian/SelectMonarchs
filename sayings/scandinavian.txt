Ambition and revenge are always hungry
Ask for advice, then use your head
Better ice that melts than fi re that extinguishes
Don’t praise the bread that is not out of the oven
Don’t sail out farther than you can row back
Even a small star shines in the dark
Fish bite best on a golden hook
Fresh air impoverishes doctors
Heaven dries what it has made wet
It is the great north wind that made the Vikings
It is too late to learn to swim when the water is up to your lips
Love has produced some heroes but many idiots too
A man without money is like a boat without sails
The most diffi cult mountain to cross is the threshold
No answer is also an answer
Nobody is too young to die tomorrow
Rain does not stay in the sky
A small cloud may hide both sun and moon
There is no wind that blows right for the sailor who does not know where the 
harbor is
The winter does not leave without a backward glance
