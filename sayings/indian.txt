Every dog is a tiger in his own street
The heart at rest sees a feast in everything
He who answers is inferior to the one who asks the question
Hunger drives good taste away
If you live on the river, befriend the crocodile
It’s easy to throw something into the river but hard to get it out again
A man laughs at others and weeps for himself
Never stand in front of a judge or behind a donkey
Never use a dwarf to measure the depth of water
No sin is hidden to the soul
One and one sometimes make eleven
One man’s beard is burning, and another warms his hands by it
Only the nightingale understands the rose
Pearls are of no value in a desert
Poverty destroys all virtues
Poverty makes thieves, like love makes poets
Theologians, dogs, and singers always disagree
The voice of the poor has no echo
Turkeys, parrots, and hares don’t know what gratitude is
We admire what we do not understand
What does the blind man know of the beauty of the tulip?
When the bed breaks, there is the ground to lie on
The world fl atters the elephant and tramples on the ant
You do not stumble over a mountain, but you do over a stone
