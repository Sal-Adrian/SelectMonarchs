A man should stay alive if only out of curiosity
An imaginary ailment is worse than a disease
Better ten times ill than one time dead
Better the best of the worst than the worst of the best
Better to hear curses than to be pitied
A clock that stands still is better than one that goes wrong
Every man knows that he must die, but no one believes it
Every pot will fi nd its lid
Experience costs blood
God sends burdens, and shoulders
Health? Very nice! But where will we get potatoes?
He that lies on the ground cannot fall
He who has children will never die of starvation
If you eat your bagel you will have nothing in your pocket but the hole
If you stay at home you won’t wear out your shoes
If you want your dreams to come true, don’t sleep
Money buys everything but good sense
One does not live on joy or die of sorrow
Sleep faster —we need the pillows
When a thief kisses you, count your teeth
With money in your pocket, you are wise, handsome, and you sing well too
