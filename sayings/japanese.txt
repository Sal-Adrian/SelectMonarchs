Advertising is the mother of trade
A bath refreshes the body, tea refreshes the mind
Better to wash an old kimono than borrow a new one
Character can be built on daily routine
The character of a man lies not in his body but in his soul
Flattery is the best persuader of people
Growing rice gives you more than poetry will
The lotus fl ower blooms in the mud
The most beautiful fl owers fl ourish in the shade
Never rely on the glory of the morning or the smiles of your mother-in-law
One joy can drive away a hundred sorrows
One moment of intense happiness prolongs life by a thousand years
A pig used to dirt turns its nose up at rice
The prettiest of shoes makes a sorry hat
Time spent laughing is time spent with the gods
Too much politeness is impertinent
To the starving man the beauty of Fujiyama has no meaning
Truthful words are seldom pleasant
Unhappiness can be a bridge to happiness
Unspoken words are the fl owers of silence
You have to bow a few times before you can stand upright
You should climb Mount Fujiyama once in your life. Climb it twice and youâ€™re a fool
