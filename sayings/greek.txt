Donâ€™t forget to distrust
Greeks only agree with each other about going to the toilet
The heart that loves is always young
He who eats and drinks with the rich leaves the table hungry
He who thinks the worst usually is right
He who wants to be happy must stay at home
Listen to that which is well said, even if it from the mouth of an enemy
My donkey is dead; let no more grass grow
An old enemy never becomes a friend
Observe your enemies, for they fi rst fi nd your faults
One minute of patience can mean ten years of peace
One word spoken in anger may spoil an entire life
The people make the town
Remorse is worse than a beating
Success has many friends
Time is the soul of the world
Under every stone sleeps a scorpion
Where there is a sea there are pirates
Whoever feeds the wolf in the winter will be eaten by him in the spring
Women are as changeable as the sea
