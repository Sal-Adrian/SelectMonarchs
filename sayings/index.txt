The nouns, adjectives, and verbs of the 
proverbs are indexed under the base form 
(the singular noun or the infi nitive of the 
verb), thus “Children should be seen and 
not heard” is indexed under child, see, and 
hear, and “Easier said than done” is indexed 
under easy, say, and do. The same principle 
applies to verb forms used as nouns and 
adjectives (such as those ending in -ing and 
-ed): for blessing and blessed look under bless, 
for lining look under line, for willing look 
under will, for broke look under break, and 
for shorn look under shear. Other derived 
forms, such as nouns ending in -er and 
adverbs ending in -ly, have their own key-
words, for example, loser and badly. Note 
that common words such as thing, man, 
all, have, and do are not always indexed. 
Hyphenated forms and two-word com-
pounds are indexed under their separate 
elements, thus “Beauty is only skin deep” 
is listed under beauty, skin, and deep, and 
“Don’t jump from the frying pan into the 
fi re” is under jump, fry, pan, and fi re.
