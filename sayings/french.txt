A day is lost if one has not laughed
The best herbs are in the smallest bags
The best soup is made of old meat
Eat with pleasure, drink with measure
The friends of our friends are our friends
A good meal ought to begin with hunger
He who has much, wants more
It is only the fi rst bottle that is expensive
Life is an onion that you peel crying
A living dog is better than a dead lion
No saint was ever popular in his own parish
Nothing dries so fast as tears
Patience is bitter but its fruits are sweet
Ridicule kills
Tasty is the chicken that is fed by someone else
There are more old drunkards than old doctors
We are all a long time dead
Where love sets the table food tastes at its best
Where the hostess is beautiful the wine is delicious
Young saints, old devils
